        'NWSL and players association agree to abolish draft, raise player pay in new CBA',
    body:
        'The National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) and NWSL Players Association have a new collective bargaining agreement, one which includes higher pay, expanding benefits and – in a notable move – abolishing the draft.\n\nWith the new CBA, which will be in place through 2030, the NWSL becomes the first major American professional sports league to abolish its player draft.\n\n“The draft is an antiquated model that empowers teams to decide for Players instead of Players deciding for themselves,” NWSLPA president Tori Huster said.\n\n“Now, Players can choose the team environment that fits their needs and maximizes their opportunities. Teams will need to step up to create environments that appeal to Players.”\n\nThe agreement raises the minimum player salary, and there will be no limit for an individual player’s maximum salary. A team’s base salary cap will rise by nearly 55% over the term of the agreement from \$3.3 million in 2025 to \$5.1 million in 2030.\n\nParental leave and childcare benefits also will be further expanded under the new deal. Charter flights can be used for up to six legs in a league season, and additional charter flights are required in what the league says is “a variety of scenarios to ensure player health and safety requirements are satisfied.”\n\nPlayer movement also is addressed in the new CBA, granting unrestricted free agency and guaranteeing all contracts. Any trade, intra-league or inter-league transfer will require player consent. This, the league said in its statement announcing the CBA, aligns NWSL standard player agreements with FIFA regulations on the status and transfer of players.\n\n“Given our vision to be the best league in the world, we determined that this was the right time to align with global standards and achieve long term labor peace,” NWSL commissioner Jessica Berman said.\n\n“This CBA gives us agency over our business and gives the players agency over their careers. Our new agreement revolutionizes the game, raises standards, and innovates the business.\n\n“On behalf of our Board of Governors, I want to thank our players and their representative leadership at the NWSLPA for working together to make this possible.”',

        'Grand Stade Hassan II: Design revealed for one of the world’s largest stadiums ahead of 2030 World Cup',
    body:
        'The final of the 2030 FIFA World Cup is five years and 11 months away, and the design for the stadium which hopes to host the match has finally been revealed.\n\nThe Grand Stade Hassan II soccer stadium in Morocco – one of three countries co-hosting the tournament alongside Spain and Portugal – is being touted as potentially “the largest football stadium in the world” by designers Oualolou + Choi and Populous, with a planned capacity of 115,000.\n\nThe stadium will be situated on a 100-hectare (roughly 247 acres) site in El Mansouria, a town north of Casablanca, with a design Populous says recalls a “moussem,” a type of traditional communal tent. The Grande Stade’s take will be made from an aluminum lattice, which will cover both fans inside the stadium and tiered gardens on the outside of the stands, and a botanical garden on the ground floor.\n\nThe design, according to Tarik Oualalou, design principal and founding partner at Oualalou + Choi, “is deeply rooted in Moroccan culture, with its traditions and contemporary expressions,” he wrote in a press release. “It is rooted in ancient and primordial figures: the Moussem, the tent, and the garden, as well as the topography and landscapes of Morocco.”\n\nThe configuration appears tailored for FIFA World Cup events: the stands themselves will be separated into zones for general admission fans at each end (holding nearly 30,000 each), while the main section will be dedicated to boxes, hospitality, VIPs and VVIPs, according to the release.\n\n“(It) will be a truly iconic, landmark venue for Morocco and for football itself, that will become one of the great stadia of the world,” said Christopher Lee, managing director at Populous, EMEA.\n\nSo how would the Grand Stade Hassan II stack up against other ludicrously capacious stadia?\n\nCricket can lay claim to having the largest stadium of all, the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, India, which expanded to its massive 132,000 capacity in 2021, while the largest American football stadium belongs to the NCAA’s Michigan Wolverines, which hosts over 107,000 fans.\n\nThe world’s biggest soccer stadium is a multi-purpose venue and among the world’s most inaccessible: the Rungrado 1st of May Stadium in Pyongyang, North Korea. Opened in 1989, its official capacity is 150,000, although renovations in the 2010s spurred an investigation from website Stadium Database, which estimated the venue now seats a mere 114,000 fans.\n\nIs it a coincidence the Grande Stade Hassan II will have 1,000 more seats? Perhaps not.\n\nPopulous is no stranger to building large sporting structures: it was behind the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Emirates Stadium in London, a dozen Olympic venues and other stadia around the world.\n\nAfter five unsuccessful bids to host the FIFA World Cup, Morocco finally got its foot through the door when FIFA announced in October 2023 that the nation would co-host the 2030 finals alongside Spain and Portugal, in an unusual, elongated tournament setup that will also see one commemorative game played in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay each to mark the FIFA World Cup’s centenary.\n\nThe Grande Stade Hassan II’s design team say the stadium will be “fully compliant for FIFA competitions” and will have “the ability to host the final” of the 2030 World Cup; the final decision on which location FIFA will choose is still pending, though Real Madrid’s newly renovated Estadio Santiago Bernabéu is widely expected to be the favorite.\n\nPreparations for groundworks at the site outside Casablanca have begun, say Oualolou + Choi and Populous, so expect to see this grand design brought to life in the coming years.',

It\'s the great managers, the amazing eras of continent-dominating sides. But it\'s also the characters. The Pulises and the Pearsons, the Robbie Savages, Mike Deans and Jimmy Bullards.\n\nThe only league in the world considered to be the best where John Carver can claim he\'s the greatest coach in the league. Where David De Gea has a chant to the tune of Weather With You by Crowded House. Where we can broadcast two teams who can\'t hit a barn door on a prime TV slot on at the weekend and have the cheek to call it Super Sunday. Where Harry Redknapp can tip Wes Morgan for an England cap, despite the fact he\'s played in a Copa America.\n\nThe Premier League isn\'t always good, but it\'s always great.

        'Munichs by David Peace review – bravura portrait of a football tragedy',
    body:
        'An electrifying retelling of how the Munich air disaster changed football and Britain for ever\n\nWhy the plural? There’s only one Munich in David Peace’s new novel, and we see very little of it: the slushy runway where British European Airways flight 609 crashes on February 6, 1958; the hotel room where two survivors spend their first bewildered night; the hospital where their fellow passengers recover – or don’t. This is surely the story of one accident, one time, one team: the air crash that killed 23 out of 44 passengers, including eight of Manchester United’s players, three of its staff, and eight journalists.\n\nBut Peace’s reasoning becomes clear over the several hundred pages of this relentless, electrifying, harrowing novel. The Munich Air Disaster, so integral a part of how the football club developed, and which had such a profound impact on the city, the north of England, the sporting community and the country as a whole, might easily not have happened had takeoff been aborted. And what would the world look like then?\n\nLike much of Peace’s work, Munichs is an obsessional study in hauntology; not merely the idea that the past lives with us, but that multiple futures do, too. In extremis, time may seem to stop, but in reality, it judders on regardless, bringing with it, in this case, a grotesque juxtaposition of funerals and fixtures. What price now the victory over Red Star Belgrade that sent the team overseas?\n\nThe novel’s modus operandi is also one of juxtaposition, of a kind in which voices and scenes appear to melt into one another, marked by tonal shifts that the disoriented reader apprehends just after they have taken place, consistently wrongfooted. Here is Cissie Charlton, mother of Bobby and Jackie, filled with a sense of doom before the event that Bobby, the second of her four sons, is in danger. She rings Old Trafford from a phone box, and later arrives there to help field calls, answer letters, make endless cups of her “special tea”.\n\nThere is Jimmy Murphy, taking the managerial reins as Matt Busby lies critically ill in hospital, rousing the remnants of the team, phoning round clubs looking for replacement players, weeping over his rosary in his Whalley Range bedroom. Over there are the devastated landladies gathering together the belongings of the dead young players who had lodged with them, the taxi drivers offering survivors free rides, the kids scrabbling for tickets for the continuing season.\n\nIn the novel’s continuous present, time is relative: at Old Trafford, events accelerate, as the sporting calendar demands decisions nobody is ready to make, caught as they are in the far more exacting and unending schedule of grief. Before it seems even possible, signs of a slackening of sympathy begin to assert themselves, with the club slyly accused of mobilising sentimentality, of milking it. Meanwhile, the hospitalised watch the minutes of each day drift past, tormented by the guilt of having made it and, in Busby’s case when he finally comes to know the scale of disaster, by anguished thoughts that there were players he might just as well have left back home.',

        'Leicester are a warning of what can go wrong for clubs on limit of budget',
    body:
        '“We want to move to a new system that people have confidence in and can comply with,” the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Masters, said this past week, “and move away perhaps from normalising asterisks against league tables or long-running regulatory cases.”\n\nThat is surely right. That doesn’t mean a free-for-all or a return to the days of unregulated spending, but any competition is undermined if it becomes common practice for points won one week to be taken away by a committee the next. There appears a serious possibility of at least four clubs being docked points this season. Once a sport stops being decided on the pitch, it is in trouble.\n\nLeicester are the great motivation for all clubs who are not super-clubs. Their Premier League title in 2015-16 remains the great example of what is possible on relatively modest spending. This is the dream that has been sold: if you construct a squad spectacularly well, if half a dozen players simultaneously have the best seasons of their lives, if enough of the elite have slightly wobbly seasons, the league can be yours.\n\nBut there are no fairytales in football. Leicester’s title came two seasons after they had won the Championship while breaching financial fair play regulations, something for which they were fined £3.1m in 2018. Since then, their story has been a warning of what can go wrong for clubs that exist on the limit of their budget.\n\nNone of the three players on whom Leicester spent significant money in the summer of 2021 really worked out. Although the centre‑back Jannik Vestergaard became a regular last season, he had an indifferent first campaign. The forward Patson Daka has shown flashes but has never put together a run of any real consistency, while the midfielder Boubakary Soumaré was loaned out to Sevilla.\n\nThe feeling then was that Leicester, having finished fifth two seasons running, were scaling back because the club’s owner, King Power, whose main business involves running shops at airports, had suffered a financial downturn during the pandemic. While that may be true, it turns out there were valid concerns about compliance with the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules (PSR).\n\nThe next season, Wesley Fofana and Kasper Schmeichel left. Harry Souttar, Wout Faes and Victor Kristiansen came in, but for the first time in nine years Leicester spent less on players than they recouped. (Not that that is necessarily a bad thing: in that 2013-14 season, they swapped Ben Marshall for Riyad Mahrez and made £550,000.) The net transfer profit in 2022-23 was about £22m, but the result was relegation. Worse, it seems those measures probably were not enough to make the club compliant with PSR.\n\nSalaries have been the real problem, with the club consistently running the seventh-highest wage bill in the Premier League. The result was losses of £92.5m in 2021-22 and £89.7m in 2022-23. The wages-to-turnover ratio was running at 116%, far higher than the two teams who have been punished with points deductions for PSR breaches, Nottingham Forest (94%) and Everton (92%).\n\nCharges were brought in March and even the club’s own accounts acknowledge they are likely “to breach the profitability and sustainability loss limits for the three-year period ending with financial year 2023-24”, an awareness that presumably informed their vain attempt to argue the Premier League had no jurisdiction over them as an EFL club.\n\nThe football finance blogger Swiss Ramble estimated that, even with a generous reading of permissible deductions, they are likely to be about £29m over the £105m threshold for losses over three years. There could be problems next year as well, with Swiss Ramble projecting another breach unless Leicester can somehow turn a profit of £12m this season.\n\nThat would suggest a penalty of at least six points is likely for this season. Survival these days rarely takes 40 points, the traditional target for clubs feeling the threat of relegation, but with a probable deduction that is the total Leicester are probably going to have to get if they are not to go down. What makes it harder is that the threat of further sanctions next season restricts the extent to which they can strengthen the squad.\n\nAt the moment, with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Kelechi Iheanacho departed; Marc Albrighton and Dennis Praet released; Souttar loaned to Sheffield United; the forward Abdul Fatawu, the centre-back Caleb Okoli and the midfielder Michael Golding signed; Bobby Decordova-Reid picked up on a free and Facundo Buonanotte loaned from Brighton, their net spend is about £1m.',

        'Sunderland’s anti-riot stance shows how football clubs and cities are proudly united',
    body:
        'Friday 2 August was opening night for Sheepfolds Stables, a £4m entertainment venue on the north bank of the Wear that replaces the scrapyards and derelict land that used to lie between the Stadium of Light and the river with bars, restaurants and event spaces. People who were there spoke of an enjoyable evening of live music and drinking in the sunshine.\n\nA footbridge is being built to link Sheepfolds and the stadium with Keel Square, which lies a couple of hundred yards upriver of the traditional city centre. There is a conscious effort to refocus Sunderland on the axis running from the 2,000-capacity Empire Theatre and its associated arts spaces through the office development on the site of the old Vaux Brewery to the football venue. After years of stagnation, there is finally a sense of progress.\n\nThe mood was of satisfaction, optimism and relief at a regeneration project brought to fruition – it rapidly became despair. Less than half a mile from Sheepfolds, rioters clashed with police in Keel Square. A car was overturned and torched, a police station was set on fire, Filipino nurses on their way to emergency shifts at the Royal hospital were attacked and a mosque was targeted.\n\nBeyond the immediate violence, the awful sense of shock and fear, there are economic repercussions. On Wednesday, the Empire cancelled a performance of The Wizard of Oz while the university shut all campus buildings by 5pm in response to the threat of further violence. The commerce support organisation Sunderland Business Improvement District (BID) spoke of its fear that the riots would deter people from coming into the city with obvious consequences for business. Sunderland is not a city that can readily afford such losses.\n\nOn the following morning, as dozens of people gathered in the centre of Sunderland to help with the clearup, it was striking how many were in football shirts. One man, wearing a white 1996-97 away shirt, told the BBC how he felt the riots “misrepresented the city and the club”, which seemed a very telling formulation.\n\nAs the clip appeared on the News at One, the phrase seemed vaguely absurd, or at least it must have done to an outsider. Why was he talking about the club and their reputation? Which club? What did that have to do with anti-immigrant riots, beyond the fact that a handful of the rioters were wearing Sunderland shirts?\n\nYet in another way it made complete sense. How does a city such as Sunderland project itself to the world these days? How many people outside Sunderland ever think of Sunderland in any context other than football (other, perhaps, than its enduring capacity to declare election results early or the Nissan car plant)?\n\nThe idea of a football club as representative of a city is commonplace, so familiar now that it perhaps escapes notice how strange or recent a phenomenon that is. Once cities would have expressed pride through their industry, their university or cathedral; now, particularly for post-industrial northern cities, it’s football.\n\nFinancially, it’s important, too: tourism in Sunderland was up 3% last year, with away fans visiting the Stadium of Light considered a major factor. When Sunderland fell out of the Premier League, local businesses estimated a 4% decline in trade. Even in the Championship, Sunderland averaged attendances of 41,028 last season; that is a lot of footfall for bars, food outlets and shops.\n\nThe relationship has become two-way, as though the city is now as much a projection of the club as the club is of the city. When a city is the setting for appalling events, there is a strange sense in which the reputation of its club is harmed. And at the same time, if people want to show solidarity with their city, if they want to express or feel a sense of togetherness in a time of crisis, what better way to do it than by wearing the club shirt?\n\nThe Labour MP for Sunderland Central, Lewis Atkinson, wore a white Umbro away shirt from the late 70s as he helped sweep away debris and spoke of communities coming together to clean up the mess being “the real Sunderland”. But what was equally telling was how the club accept, perhaps even embrace their role.\n\n“When I got dressed that morning,” says Atkinson, “I just knew I wanted to wear that shirt, to me it stemmed from a determination to not allow a minority of thugs to own the most precious identity in Sunderland, to show that it was those of us sweeping away the shards of hate who were the true Sunderland.”\n\nAt 11.19pm on the night of the riots, they posted on social media: “Tonight’s shameful scenes do not represent our culture, our history, or our people. Our great city is built on togetherness and acceptance, and Sunderland will for ever be for all. We are stronger as one community. Now. Then. Always.”',

        'A century ago, Andrade and Uruguay made the Paris Olympics a global first',
    body:
        'In June 1924, L’Auto, the French sportspaper that had launched the Tour de France, ran a large portrait on its front page. This was the Olympic Games of the Finnish runner Paavo Nurmi and his five gold medals; of Harold Abraham and Eric Liddell, whose story would be told in Chariots of Fire; of Johnny Weissmuller, who would later play Tarzan, winning three swimming golds; of WB Yeats’s brother, Jack, winning Ireland’s first ever medal, in the painting that formed part of the culture programme of that era; but the face of the 1924 Paris Games was the Uruguay centre-half José Andrade.\n\nThis was remarkable for two reasons. First because this was the first football tournament to feature countries from Europe and the Americas, a combination that made it the most popular and profitable sport at the Games. And second because Andrade was black. The 1924 Olympics was the Games in which DeHart Hubbard became the first African-American to win gold, in the long jump, but it also gave football its first black superstar, its first global superstar.\n\nAndrade was clearly a player of immense talent. He is one of only four who played for Uruguay in the finals of the 1924 and 1928 Olympics and the 1930 World Cup. Sober historians will point out that the best player was probably the inside-forward Héctor Scarone, while the leader was the right-back José Nasazzi, who always wore a homemade white knitted cap.\n\nBut it was Andrade, charismatic and good-looking, who captured the Parisian imagination. His race, as the accompanying text in L’Auto made clear, was a major part of that: the caption described him as “the marvellous and black half-back”.\n\nHe was quick and athletic, and was noted for la tijera, a scissoring way he would play the ball while grounded, but he seems to have dominated games less by physicality than by his understanding of space and angles.\n\nWhen the novelist Colette was dispatched to the Uruguay base in Argenteuil in northern Paris to speak to the team, it was Andrade she really wanted. She watched the team celebrate with an Argentinian band, with Andrade, a gifted carnival musician, joining in on the drums. “Uruguayans,” Colette wrote in Le Matin, “are a strange combination of civilisation and barbarism. Dancing the tango they are wonderful, sublime, better than the best gigolo. But they also dance African cannibal dances that make you shiver.”\n\nThat’s not a description that lands comfortably in the modern consciousness, but it was characteristic of the time. To the Parisian intelligentsia, Andrade was the embodiment of primitive modernism, to which, thanks to Picasso, Apollinaire and Stravinsky, they were in thrall.\n\nHe was dubbed the Black Pearl and it was inevitable that he would meet up with the person in Paris at the time who shared the nickname, the jazz singer Josephine Baker, whose greatest fame would come a couple of years later with the danse sauvage, performed in just strategically arranged necklaces and a skirt made of 16 bananas. They danced a tango together; whether their relationship went further was a matter of speculation.\n\nAnd there was plenty of that. Andrade clearly relished the attention. Even if many of the stories about him were exaggerated, he enjoyed a vibrant social life and by the end of the tournament was dressing as a dandy in leather boots, yellow gloves, a silk cravat and a top hat.\n\nUruguay had entered the Olympic football only on the whim of their government’s minister plenipotentiary in Switzerland, Eduardo Buero, who had been dispatched to a Fifa congress in Geneva the previous year to sign up to the global body as part of a power struggle between two rival football federations in Montevideo.\n\nThey were the only South American entrants but the USA sent a team and so too did Egypt, who sprung a major shock by beating Hungary 3-0 in the second round. So appalled were the Hungarians that their government launched an official inquiry, the interviews for which remain in the official archives.',

        'England could still become serious Euro challengers but there is plenty to fix',
    body:
        'Italy won the World Cup in 1982 and Portugal the Euros in 2016 after drawing all three games in the initial group. Spain in 2010 and Argentina in 2022 both began their World Cup-winning campaigns with defeat. This year, Ivory Coast lost group games 1-0 to Nigeria and 4-0 to Equatorial Guinea, qualified for the last 16 only because Ghana conceded twice in injury time against Mozambique and still went on to win the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nOnly Brazil, in 2002, have won seven games out of seven at a major tournament. It is possible for a team that has begun poorly to win it. But just because something is possible, doesn’t mean that’s how you should do things. Tournaments are short; average teams sometimes can be mysteriously energised. England haven’t ticked a box by getting in a couple of bad performances when it didn’t really matter. Planning tends to win out over shrugging and hoping for the best.\n\nThat’s why the performance against Denmark was so alarming. England were far from good against Slovenia but there was a qualitative difference from the Denmark draw. At least against Slovenia, once England had got over a distinctly edgy first 20 minutes it was a familiar form of bad, the sort of flatness that has become familiar from the poorer performances England have produced in tournaments under Gareth Southgate.\n\nBut there was some structure, there were occasional glimmers of positivity and England, without ever looking in danger of conceding, might have pinched a 1-0 win. It may have been almost unwatchable, but it’s at least not inconceivable that a team could progress from that in a couple of weeks to the sort of performance that does win tournaments.\n\nThat was not the case in the draw against Denmark, when there was a worrying sense fans had their England back; it wasn’t just that it was incoherent, it was that England seemed morally broken, incapacitated by a characteristic blend of ego and dread, struggling to play 10 yards passes at half-pace.\n\nIvory Coast are a poor precedent because they were so bad they ended up sacking their manager before the knockouts; that really did feel like a triumph born of randomness and defiance. But Italy in 1982, Spain in 2010, Portugal in 2016 and Argentina in 2022 all had a basic system in place; they all needed just a couple of tweaks, a player to catch light, to move from their poor start to glory. Squint at the draw with Slovenia and in a good light you might just about glimpse a sense of structure.\n\nSmall changes can have profound effects; for all the criticism of the lack of width on the left, Kieran Trippier played at left-back when England outplayed Italy at Wembley in qualifying. Eight of that side, in fact, started against Serbia in the first game of the tournament, although Phil Foden was on the right rather than Bukayo Saka with Marcus Rashford on the left. Marc Guéhi has replaced the injured Harry Maguire, while Kalvin Phillips’s form made him unselectable even before injury intervened. As Southgate acknowledged, England have struggled to replace him; given how little Phillips has played over the past two years, that England are still scrabbling around for a solution seems like negligence.\n\nIt’s a rare failure of planning for a manager whose meticulousness has been his key virtue. It’s understandable Southgate is reluctant to make radical changes now – the calls to switch to a 3-4-3 or to use Saka as a left-back seem implausible – but would it have been impossible at some point, particularly once it became apparent that there was a shortage of left-footed left-backs, to try a 4-3-3? In that formation, rather than the full-backs advancing, John Stones would step into midfield in possession, creating the 3-2 trapezoid shape Pep Guardiola uses to guard against the counter, with Jude Bellingham and Foden in effect inside-forwards, with pace and width on either flank to burst beyond Kane through Saka (or Cole Palmer) and Rashford (or, given his absence, Anthony Gordon or possibly Eberechi Eze).\n\nThat would also mitigate the issue that Trippier cannot overlap on the left because he has always to check back on to his right foot. But that would require Bellingham to revert to something like role he had before moving to Real Madrid, before the anachronistic idea of building the team around him took hold, and is also predicated on Kane being fit, which he seems not to be, and Rashford being in form, which he has not been for months. That is where it can be seen how multiple minor issues have compounded, creating the sense of incoherence and eventually panic that gripped England against Denmark.\n\nInstead, the lack of balance has magnified problems for which Southgate cannot really be blamed: Kane’s back injury, Rashford’s loss of form and the weariness of Saka and Bellingham. Perhaps Kobbie Mainoo’s effervescence will stimulate the midfield, but England’s openness when he and Rice were paired at the back of midfield against Iceland is a concern and the past two weeks have shown he is Southgate’s third-choice for the role.\n\nSlovakia, certainly, will sense an opportunity. Under Francesco Calzona, they have become a progressive side far removed from the dour plodders of previous tournaments, which may give England a little more space and make them look a little more incisive. Not that it worked for Belgium, who have at times in this tournament looked distinctly English in their lethargy and lack of cohesion.\n\nAt the same time, though, England will have to beware the forward surges of the full-backs, David Hancko and Peter Pekarik; there will be tracking for the wide forwards to do, which might be a case to stick with Saka over Cole Palmer from the start. And Ivan Schranz’s goals against Belgium and Ukraine suggest Trippier (assuming Luke Shaw is not fit enough to start) may have more defensive work to do than previously.\n\nIs it possible England could become serious challengers at this tournament? Ivory Coast showed anything is possible and England are not in such a bad state as they were. But if you were looking to win the tournament, you wouldn’t start from here.',

        'The Confederation of African Football announced on Friday that the 2025 Cup of Nations will kick-off in 2025. Which is something, given neither of the past two Cups of Nations were played in the right year. But it won’t end in 2025, kicking off on 21 December and finishing on 18 January. Yet the truth is, that is probably the least bad option available – and for once it isn’t really Caf’s fault.\n\nThis will be the seventh Cup of Nations in a row that has not gone ahead as originally scheduled for a variety of reasons including unrest in Libya, Moroccan panic over an outbreak of Ebola in Guinea, delays in the construction of Cameroonian infrastructure, Covid and the Ivorian rainy season. But this is slightly different.\n\nThe previous changes were the result of politics, disease and disorganisation – and a weird reluctance to acknowledge an annual meteorological phenomenon. This chaos is almost entirely the result of Fifa’s desire to impose another tournament on the game and the wrangling over football’s calendar.\n\nBack when the majority of players at a Cup of Nations were based in Africa, the tournament was played in the March of even-numbered years. By the late 80s, though, as more and more Africans joined European sides, that began to cause difficulties with clubs reluctant to release players as domestic seasons came to a climax. From 1992, the Cup of Nations moved to a January start, taking advantage of the pause in the French season over Christmas.\n\nFor two decades the schedule remained the same, with Issa Hayatou, the longtime president of Caf, robustly defending the principle that the Cup of Nations should be played every two years. It is, after all, the biggest source of revenue for the African game, generating far more money than the club competitions and, given how few qualifying slots there are for African nations at the World Cup (not that recent performances have justified more), it was the only way most African countries could experience international competition.\n\nBut it came to be realised, particularly after 2010 when South Africa hosted the World Cup, that the Cups of Nations played in World Cup years were diminished.\n\nFor the countries who had qualified for the World Cup, there was a sense of it as a warm-up tournament. (“Rafik, Rafik … you’ve just lost a semi-final 4-0 to your biggest rivals; what do you have to put right before you face England in June?”) And perhaps it was not fair on players to expect them to undergo the emotional expenditure of a major tournament twice in six months. So, from 2013, the Cup of Nations was moved to odd-numbered years.\n\nWhich worked fine until 2017 when Hayatou was toppled by Ahmad Ahmad, who at that point was an ally of Gianni Infantino. Ahmad came in promising reform and transparency; they always do. Hayatou had many faults but he was stubborn and cussed and understood Fifa politics.\n\nThat he presided over an institution that was dysfunctional and often corrupt is obvious (it’s football, what do you expect?), but on certain fundamentals of the African game he was impressively immovable.\n\nAhmad called a huge symposium in Rabat to discuss issues facing the African game. It was suggested there that the Cup of Nations should be moved to June-July in odd-numbered years to lessen friction with European clubs. Which would be a fine idea were it not for the west African rainy season. The 2019 tournament, moved to Egypt because Cameroon’s preparations were behind, was held successfully in June-July. It was hot, but not unbearably so although with Mediterranean temperatures rising that is not something that can be relied upon.\n\nCovid led to the 2021 Cup of Nations in Cameroon being played in January/February 2022, avoiding the issue. The 2023 Cup of Nations was played in Ivory Coast in January/February this year after somebody finally took note of the average rainfall in Abidjan in June. But everything seemed set for June/July in Morocco next year. Then Infantino came up with his expanded Club World Cup wheeze and slapped it in the calendar over the Cup of Nations dates. Whether any of the seven African members of the Fifa Council, who include the usually astute Moroccan Fouzi Lekjaa, objected is unclear.\n\nThat tournament may not even go ahead. The players union Fifpro and the World Leagues Association are opposed and less than a year before the scheduled start no stadiums have been booked, no tickets sold and no TV deal agreed.\n\nBut Caf can’t take the risk. Initially the thinking was the Cup of Nations could be played in July/August but if the Club World Cup does go ahead that is manifestly unfair on any players expected to play in both (quite apart from those at European clubs, it is likely significant numbers of Egypt’s squad will be drawn from Al-Ahly and South Africa’s from Mamelodi Sundowns).\n\nSo, back to the old problem of playing the Cup of Nations in a World Cup year and January/February 2026? That space no longer exists thanks to the expanded Champions League format. Besides, there is a Fifa regulation that clubs are under no obligation to release players for more than one competition in a year. Which left December 2025/January 2026, (just about) bypassing that regulation on a technicality.\n\nPremier League clubs would lose players from the hectic festive programme, but there are no good solutions. Overseas TV audiences may even go up; it could be that Benin v Togo from Tangier is just the thing with the post-turkey digestif.\n\nBut the detail of the solution is arguably less significant than the source of the problem. After the Rabat symposium, African football made a significant change to try to fit in with the world game. Its reward has been to be undermined by a governing body inventing a new tournament nobody seems to want and trying to ram it into an already packed calendar.\n\nIt is always those down the chain who suffer for careless leadership. The game’s elite can shrug; for them the Club World Cup means little more than a pre-season tour mildly inconvenienced. But this folly leaves African football scrabbling around to find a time to play its tournament, one it desperately needs.',

        'Europe\'s top footballing competition will kick into gear later this month when the draw for the brand new first round takes place on August 29.\n\nBut fans will be more bothered about the change to the competitionThe Champions League anthem is Tony Britten\'s 1992 adaption of the 1727 classical piece \'Zadok the Priest\'.\'s iconic soundtrack.\n\nThe iconic song was written by George Frideric Handel.\n\nBut while the song will still be the anthem of the competition, it\'s had a bit of a revamp.\n\nAn updated version of the classic has seen the tempo of the song increased, while the newest version also has an added emphasis on the vocal, rather than the vocals.\n\nFans on social media aren\'t too happy with the updated version, with one saying: "This is horrible."\n\nAnother said: "Please tell me this is an April Fool\'s joke in August, please tell me this isn\'t true, please."\n\nMeanwhile a third simply wrote: "The beautiful game has died".\n\nOf course the anthem won\'t be the only big change to this season\'s Champions League tournament.\n\nThat is because the competition has had a revamp with the group stage scrapped and replaced with a league system.\n\nThe new first round will see 36 teams competing in a single league phase that includes all sides.\n\nEach team will play eight fixtures - four at home and four away - with all matches taking place over a ten-week period.\n\nThis means there will be an increase in games as 189 matches will be played rather than the 125 that has previously taken place.\n\nAs a result, the top eight sides in the league will qualify for the knockout rounds, while those placed between ninth and 24th will enter a play-off round.\n\nThat play-off round will be contested over two legs, home and away, with the winners advancing to the 16-team knockout round.\n\nFrom the last 16, there is also set to be a tennis-style seeding system.\n\nThis ensures that the top four teams can\'t play each other until the semi-finals, while the top two from the league could only face one another in the final.\n\nThe Champions League draw takes place on Friday August 29 with all of the action and reaction on talkSPORT.com.\n\n',
